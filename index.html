            About Me
        </h2>
        <p>
            My name is Nabeel Alghaith. I am attending North Carolina State University in Raleigh
            while achieving a B.S degree in Computer Science with a concentration in Game Development 
            with a minor in Mathematics. Some courses that I have taken that have strengthened my skills are 
            Operating Systems, Software Engineering, C and Software Tools, Software Development Fundamentals, 
            Interactive Game Design, Game Engine Foundations, and Data Structures and Algorithms.
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of school, I like to play and create video games. Being in the video game industry 
            has been a dream of mine since middle school. I like to attend game jams and view other people's 
            work. I am also in the Video Game Development Club at my college where we attend workshops in different 
            topics while also having mini game jams. I had the amazing opportunity to attend GDC 2024 with the club 
            and it has inspired me to continue with game design.
        </p>

            Some other hobbies I enjoy are hanging out with friends, spontaneous trips, and relaxing at home while 
            watching a TV show or movie either with friends and family or by myself. I also try to keep a workout 
            routine when I have the time to.
